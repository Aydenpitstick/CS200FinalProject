:: Adding Ads {"position":"900,250","size":"100,100"}
Ads can be a good way to make money from a game if they are implemented in the right way. An unintrusive way to add ads to a game is have a little popup box every once in a while that allows the player to choose to watch an ad to get a reward. Now that you have added ads you could also add microtransactions or move on to picking a platform.

The Mac operating system or macOS is owned by Apple. In order to make a game playable on a macOS device the game must be written on a macOS device. Most of the time games written on a Windows device are not compatible on a macOS device.

:: Microtransactions {"position":"775,325","size":"100,100"}
Microtransactions can be a good thing to add to games to help them make money, if they are added the right way. Adding things like optional cosmetics that players can buy is usually a good route. However, certain microtransactions can make the game pay to win which could remove the fun from the game.
